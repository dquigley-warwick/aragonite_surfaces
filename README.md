# aragonite_surfaces

Contains [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) structure input files for various hydrated surfaces of the aragonite CaCO3 polymorph. 

These structures were used in:

A. M. Bano, P. M. Rodger, and D. Quigley, [New Insight into the Stability of CaCO3 Surfaces and Nanoparticles via Molecular Simulation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/la501409j) _Langmuir_, 2014, **30**, 25, 7513â€“7521.

Surfaces are divided into two groups. The group `ortho` contains simulation cells in which the surface of interest can be modelled within an orthorhomic simulation cell. The group `trlin` contains cells for which the specified surface needs a triclinic cell. Within each group `README.md` provides an index.
